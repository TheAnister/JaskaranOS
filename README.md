# JaskaranOS
JaskaranOS - A command-based operating system, built on Python

# Description
JaskaranOS (a.k.a JOS) is a command-based operating system that was made on Python by Jaskaran. Work started on it on 27/09/2022, and the first version was released on 01/10/2022. It is an open-source operating system that does most basic stuff that you would find on a UNIX shell, and if you want, you can run CMD commands on it.

# Adding your own commands
## Locally
To add in your own commands, you first need to download the latest version of JaskaranOS [here](https://github.com/TheAnister/JaskaranOS/releases/tag/JaskaranOS). Inside the `source code.zip` file, you will find a file named `main.py`. Extract that file to any location you want, and then open it up using a text editor. Scroll all the way down, and then just before the last ```elif```, write your own command using this format:
```
  elif a == "test":
    print("This is just a test.")
```

## Publishing your own commands
To publish your own command using [this form](https://forms.gle/E51v22UuDgpYzEkU9). The form will be checked at least once a month, and if your response gets approved, it will be added to the latest version of JaskaranOS.

# Statistics
This program is no easy feat. It took two weeks before the first update was ready to be released, with four hours a day being dedicated to finishing this program. Now that it has been completed, the main contributor (Jaskaran) is dedicating all his efforts into making this the best Python OS yet.
